<h1>Atlis</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Atlis is an <b>At</b>tempt at <b>Lis</b>p, written in C++. Sort of Scheme, but differing
where I would prefer (eg Common Lisp T and NIL for booleans).
</p>
<p>Status: Just started, but close-ish to getting up and running on a basic level. No I/O yet.</p>
<p>Todo: function/lambda arguments; system initialization; I/O;
